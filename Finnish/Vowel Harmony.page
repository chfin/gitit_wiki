Vowel harmony is a rule applying to certain vowels in suffixes.

# Vowel groups

Vowels are grouped according to the way they are spoken:

front neutral rear
----- ------- ----
  ä      e     a
  ö      i     o
  y            u

# The rule

The non-neutral vowels of a suffix must always be in the same vowel group as the non-neutral vowels of the rest of the word
If the word is a compound, the suffix must match the last part of the word.
If the word (or its last part) contains only neutral vowels, front vowels are preferred.
Note, that there are no words in the Finnish language, that contain both front and rear vowels, except for compound words.
